Methods
1 - Use Updated PUPPI when ready ~September.
2 - There a proposal to improve Effective Area. Need a recipe to apply it.
3 - Need a working version of PF reweight method.


Validation
1 - Add all the relevant histograms to the data NTuple reader.
2 - Read all datasets to the same histgrams (_global)
3 - Do validation plots with rations (using full normalized plots).
4 - Add all validation plots to the latex file.
5 - Plots for the zz candidate.
6 - Plots for the candidate1.
7 - Use the Z->mumu sample to get more fakes.
8 - Make plots with the fakes which pass the selection.
9 - Do ROC Curves with data and compare them to MC.
10 - Use a tight cut for both electrons when selecting the background.


Differential Studies
1 - Propagate Efficiency plots with error bars to the whole differential studies section (now is just in some parts of the Number of Vertices study).
2 - Complete the Pseudo-Rapidity differential study.
3 - Add plots with cut points, add them to the latex files.


Other
1 - Update MC Ntuple reader to be consistent with new NTuples.
2 - Introduce histograms in relative units for all isolations variables.
3 - DoubleEG - files 104, 105, 21, 37, 40, 48, 50, 82, 96 not working!
4 - SingleElctron - file 7 not working!
5 - DoubleMuonLowMass - file 1 not working!
6 - DoubleMuon - files 1, 2 not working!
