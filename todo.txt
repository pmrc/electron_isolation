Methods
1 - Use Updated PUPPI when ready ~September
2 - There a proposal to improve Effective Area. Need a recipe to apply it.
3 - Need a working version of PF reweight method.


Validation
1 - Write a NTuple reader for data which separates signal from background.
2 - Do validation plots with rations (using full normalized plots).
3 - Write latex file to compile all validation plots.
4 - Plots for the zz candidate.
5 - Plots for the candidate1.
6 - Use the Z->mumu sample to get more fakes.
7 - Make plots with the fakes which pass the selection.
8 - Do ROC Curves with data and compare them to MC.
9 - Improve the choice of the Z candidate.


Differential Studies
1 - Propagate Efficiency plots with error bars to the whole differential studies section (now is just in some parts of the Number of Vertices study).
2 - Complete the Pseudo-Rapidity differential study.
3 - Add plots with cut points, add them to the latex files.


Other
1 - Apply vertex weights to Monte Carlo
