- Propagate Efficiency plots with error bars to the whole differential studies section (now is just in some parts of the Number of Vertices study).
- Complete the Pseudo-Rapidity differential study.
- Add plots with cut points, add them to the latex files.
- Use Updated PUPPI when ready ~September
- There a proposal to improve Effective Area. Need to study it.
- Write a NTuple reader for data which separates signal from background
- Do validation plots with rations (using full normalized plots)
- Write latex file to compile all validation plots
- Plots for the zz candidate
- Plots for the candidate1
- use the Z->mumu sample to get more fakes
- make plots with the fakes which pass the selection
- reweight pile-up in mc to match the data
